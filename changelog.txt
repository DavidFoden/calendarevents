v 1.1.0:
- added api to add events on runtime
- checking for existing events with same label (no overriding)
- event with only past timings will be removed
- recalculate timings of event if there are no next timings (should fix problems arising when plugin was running for a few weeks)
- calculating of next millis to call is more efficient
- removed unused data file
