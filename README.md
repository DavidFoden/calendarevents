This is plugin for minecraft written with the Spigot/Bukkit API. You can find the plugins site on Spigot here: <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/calendar-events.35536/" target="_blank">Link</a>.

Calendar Events is intended to be used for repeating occasions in rl-time on which you want to run code. It allows to call a custom event with a preccicion of about 2 tics (~100ms) and has a build in listener to run some basic code when an event is fired.

The configuration file allows to easily set up the date and time for an event. To later recognise the occasion of the event i am using the previously defined labels of the events from the configuration file.
